# Intrusion Detection at ATMs

Its crucial for financial systems to have sound security measures in place. For security reasons customers are not
allowed to wear a helmet while using ATM(Automated Teller Machine). An automated helmet detection using
ATM surveillance camera feed can help improve security significantly. Recently deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) have shown state of the art accuracy in object detection and localization. In this work, a pretrained
Googleâ€™s inception v3 model have been used and have achieved an accuracy of 95.3% by training the model on a
proprietary ATM surveillance dataset. Transferred information from inception model has been feed to multiple fully
connected layers with drop outs to achieve better accuracy.
